/**********************************************
 PROJECT ANALYSIS EQUATION
 **********************************************/

the project analysis equation is currently:

W = GW (dG * I * P * T * A * Ex * En)/(Yr * $)

where the parameters are defined as follows:

GW [0,1] =  global weighting, a parameter to reflect the priority level of
	    this project with respect to the collective high level
	    strategy (note: strategy part of the site to be
	    implemented in the future; for now this factor is not counted)
dG [0,1] =  the incremental (delta) difference the project makes in achieving
	    your goals
I [0,1] =   your interest in doing the project
P [0,1] =   the probability of the project succeeding
T [0,1] =   the timeliness of the project (now versus later)
A [0,1] =   your comparative advantage in working on the project
	    (skills you bring, would it get done without you, etc.)
Ex [0,1] =  externalities (social, environmental). 
En [0,1] =  the enabling role that this project will have for other
	    projects or for your skillset, experience, or contacts
	    (which in turn contributes to your ability to better
	    implement future projects)
HH [yrs] =  estimated time needed to implement the project
$ [$] =     estimated money needed to implement the project
W [1/] =   the final weighting of the project, as calculated from the
	    above values. 


/**********************************************
 DATA STRUCTURES
 **********************************************/

the project analysis module implements a new database table with the
following information (in addition to the standard node information
such author, comments, last updated times, etc.

note that the 'project name' and 'decscription' fields make use of the
standard node 'title' and 'body' fields respectively. these listed
below are additional:

### ALL PUBLIC PROJECTS #####

the module implements a custom page that lists all public projects (if
you are familiar with the views module, this is essentially a custom view for a
the custom module, since the views module does not let you work with
the custom fields of custom modules, alas). 

this page is accessible at http://example.com/?q=projects (or just
/projects if you have clean URLs enabled). you may want to add this to
either a menu somewhere or, probably, as a primary link. 

### MY PROJECTS  #####

the module also implements a homepage for each user to view all their
own projects, public and private.
